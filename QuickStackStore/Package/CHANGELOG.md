## 1.2.5
- Stacks of items with custom data can no longer get merged by sorting or get restocked to improve compatibility. Overhauled translation system, added chinese translation by Tiomer. Option to override the Take All button label
## 1.2.4
- Fixed quick stacking sometimes not starting since version 1.2, because the game thinks there is a held item when there isn't. "Quick stack only one item" feature disabled until better implementation is found
## 1.2.3
- Increased performance for quickstacking when using other mods that listen for Inventory.Changed calls (by reducing the amount of calls, related: xkcd.com/1691)
## 1.2.2
- Reverted 1.2.1 due to logic error
## 1.2.0
- Replaced favoriting mode hotkey with favoriting mode UI button (disabled by default, just like the old hotkey)

- Fixed compatibility with SmarterContainers and Backpacks by excluding my changes to the 'Take All' Button, and added config option to do this regardless of mod setup for compatibility
- When disabling quick slots in EAQS the mini buttons will now revert to being horizontal rather than vertical
- Sorting stack merging now respects quality of modded items (base game stackables don't have quality)
- Lessened likelihood of issue with the trash can UI button when using Better UI Reforged and changing display configs while ingame (the proper fix will be included in Better UI Reforged)
